			<h1>Lab 2 -Hello World!</h1>
			<p>Hi, we are Victoria and Shirley! We have very little programming experience but we decided to 
				work together because why not. Victoria is into drawing and painting, and Shirley is also into 
				different forms of art. We find that programming can be a little bit challenging,
				 but we are willing to put in the time and effort to learn in this class!</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was kind of difficult to understand the instructions on Canvas. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Initially, we found it difficult because we couldn't figure out how to
						launch the website. We messed around for a bit and then retraced our steps on Canvas and
						managed to figure it out. We were both able to get it to work through problem solving.
