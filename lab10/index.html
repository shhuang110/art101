            <h1>Problems</h1>
            <div>
                <p>A problem I had was my button wasn't working. I found out that it's because I needed my event to be inside the click event handler. I also misplaced the document ready function so it didn't load correctly.
					My CSS wouldn't load correctly either, and I found out it was because I entered the wrong file name. Silly mistakes...

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Please press the button to see results!!
					NOTE: I used the bot to generate a CSS code because I got sick of my nonexistent web design skills. I made sure to take note of how they utilized the margins and padding for the text.
