					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge in this lab was getting a good grasp of the terms and what they do.
						For example, I had a little trouble wraping my head around what console.log does, and 
						I searched it up and read multiple explainations on it so that I understand what I'm doing.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't really problems going into this lab. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment went smoothly. I liked having a visual example of what my code should look like. 
						I also think that I gained a deeper understanding of the lecture contents by putting it into practice. </p>
