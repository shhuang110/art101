			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was getting used to writing functions and the different lines of code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I had was the function itself not working. In order to fix this, I rewrote the entire code in the console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was also difficult for me to do and I had to have my partner guide me through it. I found that it's hard to grasp the concept of functions in general, and I think I might need more practice with it. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					Open console to see results
