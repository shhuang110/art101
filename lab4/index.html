			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocoding</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was wrapping my head around how each step should be
						formulated. I had to constantly reference the example on canvas to get a good sense
						of what I needed to do.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> A problem that came up was that my partner and I got confused about task #2 and what we needed to do.
						We were unsure of how to approach the lab itself, and had to look up examples of what psuedo-coding would look like.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment felt like a chore more than anything. I was slow to pick up on what needed to be done,
						and had to reference a lot of outside sources to figure it out. I also thought Javascript was a completely different
					program and I don't know where I got that idea from. I don't have the strongest grasp on linking/referencing files either, so I got stuck
				on the part where we had to link the js to the html. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre><code>
