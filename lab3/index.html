					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges of this lab was formatting the code and making sure that everything
						worked the way it was supposed to. I had some trouble referencing different
						codes as well, just because I find it hard to wrap my head the concept.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that I personally had was linking the css to the html in order to change the size
						of the image. I spent around 20 minutes trying to find a solution, going so far as to looking up
					YouTube videos explaining the process. At the end of the day, I found out that I spelled "css" as "ccs"
				which was why it wasn't working. My process was correct, but this tiny mistake costed me a lot of time. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this was a bit of a challenging lab to complete. I felt kind of stupid
						because I had to reread some of the directions over and over again, and when I looked
						at the codes I got overwhelmed. I mostly relied on outside resources (Youtube and w3schools)
						to help me problem solve. I think I put in a lot of effort into this project, even though the end result looks like the bare minimum.
